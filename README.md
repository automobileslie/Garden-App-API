Plan a Garden

This is an application designed to help users imagine the kind of garden that they would like to create and then start to plan it. The idea for it came from the avid gardening I did last summer and from my appreciation of the community gardens all over New York City.

The repository for the front-end of this application can be found here: https://github.com/automobileslie/Garden-App

A demo of the project is available here: https://www.carlieanglemire.com/static/media/PlanAGardenVideo.5ba373b8.mp4

● Utilized Ruby on Rails to create an API rendered as JSON

● Stored data including updates, posts, and deletes from forms on the front-end using Ruby on Rails

● Built front-end functionality with React and React Router and styled the front-end with CSS
